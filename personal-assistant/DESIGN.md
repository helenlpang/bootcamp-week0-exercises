My todo app will start out with just one page, managing my todos. The page will have an Add button and Search button at the top, with a text bar below each for input. Below these sections, I will display my actual to-do lists. The top list will display items that I need to do. Each of these items has three buttons: complete, edit, and delete. If a button is marked as complete, it will be moved from the top list to the bottom list. The bottom list will display a list items that I have completed. These items will have three buttons: undo, edit, and delete. Clicking the undo button will return it to the to-do item list. 

Finally, below all of these items, I will display a clear button, which deletes all the items from the list.

The search function will automatically filter the list display based on substring. If there is no matching item, it will display "Nothing found! Try again." Thus the search button will not actually function - it is only a display.

All buttons will darken when hovered over - except for the search button since it is not functional. 

When the add button is clicked, it will add the task to the todo list, and the text will be cleared from the text bar.
